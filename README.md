### **Deep Learning Projects**

#### 1. **CIFAR=10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Description**: Built and trained a CNN model for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project involved data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and visualizing model predictions.
- **Dataset**: [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- **Key Outcomes**: Improved classification accuracy through dropout and batch normalization techniques.
- **Repository**: [CIFAR-10 Image Classification](https://github.com/vmahawar/cifar-10-image-classification)

#### 2. **Sentiment Analysis Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- **Description**: Performed sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset using LSTM-based RNNs. The project focused on text preprocessing, sequence padding, and embedding layers.
- **Dataset**: [IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
- **Key Outcomes**: Achieved high accuracy in detecting positive or negative sentiments with effective text vectorization.
- **Repository**: [IMDB Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/vmahawar/imdb-sentiment-analysis)

#### 3. **Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks**
- **Description**: Developed a neural network model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The project focused on using dense and convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- **Dataset**: [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- **Key Outcomes**: Achieved over 98% accuracy using an optimized neural network architecture.
- **Repository**: [MNIST Digit Recognition](https://github.com/vmahawar/mnist-digit-recognition)
