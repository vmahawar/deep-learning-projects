## Datasets and Deep Learning Projects

In my deep learning journey, I have explored various datasets and implemented deep learning models to solve real-world problems. Below is an overview of some notable deep learning projects, showcasing their objectives, datasets, and outcomes.

### **Deep Learning Projects**

#### 1. **CIFAR=10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Description**: Built and trained a CNN model for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project involved data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and visualizing model predictions.
- **Dataset**: [CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- **Key Outcomes**: Improved classification accuracy through dropout and batch normalization techniques.
- **Repository**: [CIFAR-10 Image Classification](./image-classification-of-CIFAR-10-using-CNN/)

#### 2. **Reliance Stock Closing Price Prediction with LSTM**
- **Description**: Developed an LSTM-based model for predicting Reliance stock closing prices using historical stock data. The project utilized 30-day and 120-day time windows to capture both short-term and long-term trends. Key steps included data preprocessing (normalization and sequence generation), model building with stacked LSTM layers, and performance evaluation using RMSE.
- **Dataset**: [Reliance Industries stock data](https://github.com/vmahawar/data-science-datasets-collection/raw/main/reliance_stock.csv) ([6164 rows after cleaning](https://github.com/vmahawar/data-science-datasets-collection/raw/main/reliance_stock_cleaned.csv)).
- **Key Outcomes**: Achieved reliable predictions for stock closing prices with low RMSE. The model demonstrated the effectiveness of LSTM in capturing temporal dependencies for financial time-series forecasting.
- **Repository**: [Reliance Stock Prediction with LSTM](./LSTM-long-short-term-memory-of-reliance-stock/)
